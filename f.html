            <h1>SETTING UP VISUAL STUDIO</h1>
            <h6> Visual Studio empowers you to complete the entire development cycle in one place.
                 For example, you can edit, debug, test, version control, and deploy to the cloud.
                  With the diversity of features and languages in Visual Studio, you can grow from writing your first piece of code to developing in multiple project types.
